# Welcome to Your EE209 Project Repository

- Code, simulations and other files relating to your final project implementation should be in this folder
 - You can create folders to organize your work (e.g. PCB, Firmware, Software, LTspice, Proteus, etc.)
- Unless you are quite familiar with Git, do your individual work in your own folder and manually migrate the final solutions to this folder (i.e. copy-paste relevant parts from your folder to this folder)
