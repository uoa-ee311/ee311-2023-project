# Welcome to Your EE311 Project Repository

- This is a repository used by all team members to store files related to your EE311 project
  - Use this to store all of your project work, including your LTspice models, Ansys models, firmware done using Atmel Studio, Proteus simulations, etc. 
- Rename the folders that are initially named as "Student1" to "Student4" with each of your team members preferred name
- To avoid merge conflicts, each student should only change files in their own folder
  - If you are familiar with Git then you do not have to stick to this rule 
- Once a solution for a component related to project has been developed by a student, and reviewed by the team members, these changes can be migrated to the FinalImplementation folder
  - This is to make sure you will not have any merge conflicts (i.e. no one works on the same file at the same time) 
- As a case study, consider one student working on UART code while the other student working on ADC code
  - This work should be done in your individual folders 0
  - Once you validate your code individually and all team members are in agreement, the two new features can be transferred to the FinalImplementation folder (for example copy-pasting the source file for each module and code section that goes in the man.c)
  - You will start realising the benefits of writing modular code
  - Though this is not the ideal way to use Git, it will keep things simple for you until you become a familiar with Git 
  - A better workflow will be to work on branches and merge 
- You can create as many folders and files as you wish
  - Discuss with your team and organize the repository to suit your teams need
- If you like to practice on using advanced Git features refer to https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2
